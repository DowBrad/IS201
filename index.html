                        <p class="post-meta">
                            Many individuals in Utah suffer from mental health challenges, but many of those individuals do not receive the care they need. A 2021 study found that, in general, 27.5% of those who experienced symptoms of anxiety or depression needed counseling or therapy but did not receive it for a variety of reasons. This statistic is approximately 1% higher than the national average. A 2019 report from the Kem C. Gardner Institute of Policy at the University of Utah claimed that more than half of Utah residents with mental health challenges did not receive treatment or counseling. Among young adults, specifically those enrolled in an undergraduate university, 34.4% of students report at least one mental health challenge. Of these students, only 39.4% of them receive treatment. This lack of treatment can have serious consequences. Among young adult students who die by suicide, 80% have never been seen by a campus mental health service.

                        <p class="post-meta">
                            Young adults are in a critical period of their lives. They are faced by many decisions, new experiences, and different environmental stressors. These stressors may include living in a new location, living with roommates, facing high social and academic demands and expectations, dealing with family problems, romantic relationships, balancing a difficult educational workload with a full time job, financial problems, and more. Many young adults are unprepared to face these new challenges and the additional stress can deepen the effects of pre-existing mental health challenges. Because of these different stressors, young adults are more likely to have serious thoughts of suicide or attempt suicide.

                            <h2 class="post-title">How have mental health challenges changed in recent years?</h2>
                        <p class="post-meta">
                            In recent years, reports from university mental health services have expressed an increase in the number of students struggling with mental health challenges. There are a number of reasons for this change, but they cannot all be explored on this website. However, one important factor in recent years has been the Covid-19 pandemic. Compared to the data in 2019, before the pandemic, three times as many adults report symptoms of mental health challenges. Young adults have especially been impacted by the pandemic. Young adults are already faced with an extensive set of environmental stressors as previously mentioned. Additionally, young adults do not have the stability provided by a daily routine, stable employment, or family life that other, more established, adults may have as a support during disastrous events such as the pandemic.

                            <h2 class="post-title">How does Utah compare to other states in regards to mental health challenges?</h2>
                        <p class="post-meta">
                            Utah has similar rates of mental health challenges as other states. 31.1% of adults in Utah report symptoms of mental health challenges while the national average is 31.6% among adults in the US. Although the mental health challenges rate is similar, Utah has a significantly higher suicide rate. Utah has a rate of 21.2 per 100,000 compared to the national average of 13.9 per 100,000. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young adults in Utah. These statistics suggest that although mental health challenges are faced at the same rate in Utah as is faced elsewhere, there is a significant issue in the way these challenges are faced and treated.
