                       <h2 class="section-heading">On-Campus Groups</h2>
                        <p>On-campus chapters of organizations, groups, and clubs such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or other on-campus groups have been effective in alleviating the burden from overbooked counseling and psychological services offices and eliminating barriers to accessing quality mental health care. These organizations bring students from varying backgrounds, faculty, staff, and other community leaders together to increase awareness of mental health challenges and to fill the existing gaps in the available mental health care resources. As a union of many types of people and backgrounds and because these organizations exist outside of the traditional university structure, on-campus groups can take a flexible and holistic approach to address the unique mental health challenges in their campus community by offering multiple interventions. These groups can work to petition changes in campus policies that promote negative stigmas, provide mental health screenings across campus to better identify those who need help and encourage them to receive treatment, lead mental health awareness campaigns across campus, hold free community support groups, and can align with other on-campus groups to reach out to high risk populations to raise awareness. For example, the mental health group can partner with a LGBTQ alliance group to promote mental health awareness and care. This collection of services allow these groups to address multiple causes of the inaccessibility of quality mental health care resources as well as multiple negative consequences. The main focus of these groups is reducing the suicide rate among their peers.</p>
                        <p>One of the most prominent services offered by on-campus groups is gatekeeper training. Gatekeeper training focuses on training those who are most likely to interact consistently with those suffering from a mental health challenge. These trainings consists of short workshops that teach students, faculty, and community members the warning signs of suicide, symptoms of mental health challenges, available mental healthcare resources, and the important communication skills necessary to understand the needs and concerns of others as well as to persuade those struggling with mental health challenges to seek quality treatment. NAMI’s Utah chapter offers a brief ninety minute suicide prevention workshop each month that teaches gatekeepers the skills to ask quality questions, persuade individuals to seek help, and refer those individuals to a quality mental health resources.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Impact</h2>
                        <p>On-campus mental health groups can provide many different interventions according to the needs of each unique campus community. However, one of the most prominent current practices is gatekeeper training. Without a strict centralized reporting system, it has proven difficult for researchers to collect data on controlled randomized samples of workshop participants to find if they are able to use the skills they acquired during the workshop to refer an individual suffering with a mental health challenge to a mental health resource. Because of this, proving causality between gatekeeper trainings and the local suicide rate has been difficult. However, a number of studies have found that suicide prevention initiatives which include gatekeeper trainings have correlated with a decrease in suicide-related behavior61. The impact of gatekeeper training is commonly measured by the workshop’s ability to improve knowledge about suicide, skills to address suicide risk, and confidence to address suicide risk. Gatekeeper trainings have very effectively accomplished these goals. A meta analysis of multiple studies found that gatekeeper trainings led to a large improvement in knowledge about suicide and confidence to address suicide risk. The analysis also found a moderate improvement in skills to address suicide risk.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Gaps</h2>
                        <p>There is evidence to suggest that gatekeeper training leads to a reduction in suicide-related behavior among young adults. However, because of the lack of research conducted on the impact of the workshops, it cannot be said for certain that this practice has a definitive positive impact on the suicide rate among young adults in Utah. There is a great need for impact research for gatekeeper trainings as well as other interventions. Campus based mental health groups also work exclusively with campus communities. Although universities are effective organizations to work with to impact many young adults, many young adults are not university students. In Utah, it is estimated that only 41% of the young adults in the state are enrolled at a university. That means that 59% of the young adult population is left unaided by this intervention.</p>
